INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT
----------------------

This project is my first attempt at using Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create something from scratch. 
It will continue to evolve as I research, try new things, watch tutorials, sigh with frustration, 
throw my arms up in triumph, and have my butt go numb while sitting in front of the computer. 

SUMMARY OF PROGRESS
-------------------

I coded the Tetris game by following an introductory tutorial by Ania Kubow available on YouTube. The gorgeous Schipperke 
looking into your soul from the background image is my little sister from another mother, Daisy. My Mom adopted
her at the beginning of the pandemic and she has become an irreplaceable member of the family.

Once the game was coded, I made changes to the styling and HTML by googling my questions and watching bits of other tutorials. 
Some things I solved, but many other things that I would like to do remain a mystery. I feel like I understand the most 
basic of procedures, but putting it all together and knowing what exactly influences what still feels a bit overwhelming. 

GOALS FOR VERSION 2
-------------------

* Style the Tetrominos and the grid - specifically, find out how to give them borders and make the lines
  of the grid visible
* Get the preview Tetromino more centred in the mini-grid
* Allow for a more variable drop speed as the Tetrominos descend
* Add inverse "z" and "l" Tetrominos for more game play options
* Investigate adding sound
* Investigate changing the scoring values
* Style the "Start/Pause" button
